# Calculation-Of-Beam's-Angle-Reflecting-inside-the-Polygon
My program that shows at which angle one should fire a beam in order to hit the target while beam should be reflecting all the polygon's walls

It's a Very rough version only to present the idea and starting point of the project. Here are two vids to present the project [1](https://youtu.be/pxsS2-DK5ww) and [2](https://youtube.com/shorts/K7dDbf1QGc0).
The second vid shows one of the ways the prog will be developed in fututre. 
Some more description will be added soon.
